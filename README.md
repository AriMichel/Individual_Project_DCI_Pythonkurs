Individual Project. road map that will guide you on your way to completing your first web application.


Main Goal
By the end of this course you will have created a fully functional prototype web application for a Warehouse Management System.
A Warehouse Management System is a software application designed to support and optimize warehouse functionality and distribution center management.
Wikipedia

Learning Achievements
You will learn how to create a custom dynamic web application that stores the information in a database, has a user system and let's registered users interact with the contents of the database with web forms, making persistent changes on the website content.
Methodology
From the beginning of the course, and all along the course, you will be given small incremental goals that you can reach with the knowledge acquired at every step of the learning experience, ending up with a complete road map that will guide you on your way to completing your first web application.


Include a list of the expected app features (using a list), a link to the author profile on GitHub or the home page of the Python Course.
For now, some of the features you may include are:
A user system with roles and permissions for listing and placing orders.
Maintain the stock of a warehouse.
Order items from the warehouse.
Log actions from users.
Reporting.
You can get creative when defining intended/expected features, you can always come back to the README.md to define two sections, one with planned features and the other one with features already implemented.
